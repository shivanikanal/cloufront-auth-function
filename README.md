# cloufront-auth-function
Basic auth with AWS Cloudfront functions

A simple viewer request and viewer response handler implmenting the most basic form of auth.

Note: This is a weak form of auth, not suited for anything in production. This can be improved with addition of a data store and using Lambda Edge functions.
